            The team won against 100+ competing teams with the proposed idea of "Asteroid mining bots", which suggested ways to
            exploit asteroids that are filled with potential minerals that can be beneficial for earthlings in order to solve the
            problem of lack of resources. The project includes planning and designing the technical aspects of Mining Bots using
            prototyping software.
